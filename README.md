# Image_compression_using_Autoencoders

Satellite Imagery Scene classification has been receiving remarkable attention as it plays a vital role
in a wide range of applications. However, the satellite imagery data size is quite large and often not
all of the data is useful for many downstream tasks. It would be beneficial to experiment with various
compression techniques to compress images based on the similarity of image pixels in order to optimize 
the compute time and yield a comparable model to the baseline model. Some of the commonimage compression 
techniques implemented using machine learning are usage of Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
based compression and Neural Network techniques such as auto-encoders and predictive coding. 
This project focuses on experimenting with Neural Networks and PCA for image compression.
